# Ring Oscillator PUF Optimized for Ultrascale+-Architectures

This repository is a fork of the implementation provided by Gabalo [https://github.com/Gabalo/RO_PUF](https://github.com/Gabalo/RO_PUF).

**It is currently under implementation do not clone!**

Operation: 
 - Executes a ring-oscillator PUF on a ZCU102+ board. 
 - Contains error correction using the BCH error correcting code provided by Russ Dill (https://github.com/russdill/bch_verilog)[https://github.com/russdill/bch_verilog].


The code was originaly implemented for Xilinx Artix-7 FPGAs but is currently modified to support Xlinx Ultrascale+ architectures.
